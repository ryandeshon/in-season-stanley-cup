  "Hope you enjoyed holding the Cup—for the whole five minutes! Better luck next time, champ!",
  "That was a nice try... for a minor league team. The Cup belongs with real champions!",
  "Skated right past you and took the Cup with me. Maybe brush up on your defense?",
  "The Cup doesn’t like sitting idle—it’s back where it belongs with a real team!",
  "Thanks for keeping the Cup warm, but it’s time for the real champions to take over!",
  "Guess you’ll have to watch the Cup celebration from the stands... again.",
  "I’d say ‘better luck next time,’ but we both know luck won’t help you.",
  "You can stop dreaming about the Cup now—it’s staying with a true champion!",
  "Looks like you’re just not cut out for the big leagues. Better luck in the minors!",
  "The Cup’s not a souvenir; it’s for champions only!",
  "Nice try, but it’ll take more than that to keep up with the champs!",
  "I’d say you put up a good fight, but that would be a lie.",
  "You lost the Cup so fast, I almost missed it!",
  "The Cup must’ve missed being with a real team—it’s home again!",
  "Once a challenger, always a challenger... never a champion!"
